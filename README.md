# Titanic-Machine-Learning
Kaggle Competition to Predict who would survive on the titanic from a dataset of the passengers.
I used a Random Forest Classifier to predict survival on the titanic as a binary classification.
I did a lot of presproccessing to remove null values, convert to numerical types and extract information like title from names.
